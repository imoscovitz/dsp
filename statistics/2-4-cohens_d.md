[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

First babies' mean weight is 7.20 lbs; others' is 7.32. 
There seem to be some record errors. Four of the values came in lower than the world record for the lowest birth weight for a living baby (0.57 lbs): http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/lightest-birth  
Cohen's d-score is -0.088. It's larger in magnitude than the d-score for pregnancy length, but the effect still doesn't seem very large.
