[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

First babies' mean weight is 7.20 lbs; others' is 7.32. 

FWIW, there are some likely record errors in the outliers. Four of the values came in lower than the world record for the lowest birth weight for a living baby (0.57 lbs): http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/lightest-birth 

Cohen's d-score is -0.088. It's larger in magnitude than the d-score for pregnancy length, and it's negative instead of positive, though the effect still doesn't seem very large. So others' pregnancy lengths were ever-so-slightly longer than first-births, whereas first-births weighed slightly less than did others.
